    <p>Hi, and welcome to my website. My name is Jonah Joannah Jay, and I am delighted you are here. I apoligize in advance for þe <strong>Gow-awful</strong> website design, þis is still very much a work in progress. Hopefully my designing skills will improve even more.</p>
    <p>It has always been a dream of mine to be able to create stuff on þe internet, and wiþ a blog, I can just feel free to post what I want to  post. 
        I often have a ton of creative ideas, but þey almost never fit a cohesive þeme, which I've learned þat þe algoriþms don't tend to like (don't worry It's not edgy right wing bs).
