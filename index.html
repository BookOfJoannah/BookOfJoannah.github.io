<div class="Important">HELLO MORTALS!</div>
    <p>Hi, and welcome to my website. My name is Jonah Joannah Jay, and I am delighted you are here. I apoligize in advance for þe <ul>God-awful</ul> website design, þis is still very much a work in progress. Hopefully my designing skills will improve even more.</p>
    <p>It has always been a dream of mine to be able to create stuff on þe internet, and wiþ a blog, I can just feel free to post what I want to post. 
        I often have a ton of creative ideas, but þey almost never fit a cohesive þeme, which I've learned þat þe algoriþms don't tend to like, so I decided to make my own site.
        <br/>You can obviously tell that the site became neglected for a while, but right now I'm on a mission: 1 upload per week for each week of 2025.
    </p>
    <div class="SemiImportant"><ul>Let's see if I can do it</ul></div>
    
    <div class="Important">Expect þe unexpected here. </div>
    

    <p>
        If you haven't noticed yet, I type wiþ þ. I will explain more at a later time, but for now, just let me live wiþ my weird typing quirk.
    </p>
    <div class = "Important">Here is everyþing I've done in reverse chronological order:</div>
    <div class="Articles">
