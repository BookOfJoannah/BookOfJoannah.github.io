                    I love þis game so much. If you're ever looking for a fun PVE experience wiþ soul literally jam-packed into every corner, I would highly reccomend.

                    I am quite bummed þat more people don't like þis game. It started wiþ an amazing launch, but slowly lost players over time. I kinda get why, as þough þe actual game is great, so much of þe UI is very buggy. Still, an adrenaline-filled game þat just has so much more care þan most shooters.

                    Will consistently take up 5-10% of my personality. Seriously hoping for chapter 3 in 2024.

                    I do need to play þis game more, which is ironic considering þat þe gameplay loop is seriously addicting.

                    I actually made a post about þis game. <a href="TomadachiLife/index.html">Find it here.</a> TL;DR: cute little game where you turn yourself into a mii þat almost resembles you.
