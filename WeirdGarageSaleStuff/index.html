    <h1>Weird Stuff I found at Garage Sales</h1>
    <p>So þe oþer day, my town had a giant city-wide organized garage sale, and I decided to hop on my bike and check some stuff out. Here is a compilation of þe weirdest stuff people were willing to sell to strangers</p>
    <img src="trisaber.png" alt="My hand holding a 3-pronged lightsaber with three different colors of blade." width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
    <h2>Þis weird lightsaber I found</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I found þis lightsaber in a whole bin of lightsabers. I would guess þat it isn't official Star Wars merchandise, but I would like to believe þat it is. <br> Price: Unknown</p>

    <img src="GiantCrazyHolder.JPG" alt="A giant thing supposed to be a computer holder." width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
    <h2>Þe Computer Holder of Doom</h2>
    <p>I was kinda tempted to buy þis. þe only problem was þat I didn't know where I would put it. I also didn't know how I would use it. Or why I needed it in þe first place. Ok, þere were several problems.
        <br> Price: $20-(Originally worþ about $100)</p>
     <hr/>

    <img src="ToiletPong.JPG" alt="A box with a smiling man on the toilet throwing ping-pong balls onto solo cups hung up on the door" width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
    <h2>Toilet Pong...</h2>
        <p>Ok, but like. Who would ever even want toilet pong? Þe whole idea just sounds disgusting. I just don't understand why MULTIPLE PEOPLE believed þat þis was a good idea to make. What would happen if you miss? Now þere's just a ball on þe disgusting floor of your disgusting baþroom. Also don't forget þat you are literally on þe toilet. Are people really þat bored so as to invent þis?
            <br>Price: I don't even want to know.
        </p>
<hr/>
<img src="PokerTable.JPG" alt="A literal casino-style poker table" width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
<h2>Ok, Let's Cleanse Our Palettes Wiþ Þis Sick Poker Table</h2>
        <p> Honestly, þis just looks cool as hell. I would love to have bought it, but I just don't play poker enough. Actually I've only played it once. I'm absolutely positive þat þis got sold, because, I mean, look at it. It just radiates 20þ century poker out of every piece of þis testament to gambling.
            <br> Price: I þink it was like $40 if I remember correctly
        </p>

    <hr/>
<img src="ChristmasVacation.JPG" alt="National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
<h2>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</h2>
<p>I guess þis is a famous 20þ century christmas movie. 
    <br> Price: Eiþer free or $1
</p>
<hr/>
<img src="LiterallyACannon.JPG" alt="A cannon replica in front of a suburban house" width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
<h2>Literally a Cannon in Someone's Front Yard</h2>
<p>As I was biking to a garage sale, I literally found a cannon in someone's front yard. It doesn't look it actually fires, but it would be so cool if it did. I especially love þe sign announcing þe house has been protected by a security system. It's just so redundant.
    <br> Price: Not for sale
</p>

<hr/>

    <img src="CarHeadlight.JPG" alt="A headlight from a car." width ="200" style="border-radius: 10px;">
    <p> After þe garage sale bonanza, I was out walking my dog when I came across a box filled wiþ junk þey just couldn't sell. Among þis box was a literal headlight from like a car or a motorcycle or someþing. I have literally no idea who would have bought þis, or where þe hell it ended up
    <br> Price: Literally free</p>

    <p>So yeah. Þat garage sale was pretty good. I kinda made out like a þief, walking away wiþ a bunch of stuff for like less þan $15. 10/10 good event, would go again.</p>
