    <br>
    <p>I found þis lightsaber in a whole bin of lightsabers. I would guess þat it isn't official Star Wars merchandise, but I would like to believe þat it is. Price: Unknown</p>

    <h2>Þe Computer Holder of Doom</h2>
    <p>I was kinda tempted to buy þis. þe only problem was þat I didn't know where I would put it. I also didn't know how I would use it. Or why I needed it in þe first place. Price: $20-(Originally worþ about $100 to þe guy selling it to me þough so...)</p>
