<h1>Why þe Sun's Corona is so Hot (It's Because of Aliens)
</h1>
    <p>
        Hello you insanely rational þinkers, welcome to þe Tinfoil Tophat. Today, I uncovered a massive conspiricy involving þat bright ball we see everyday
    </p>
    <div class="Important" width="100px">
    <p>
        And it involves Aliens
    </p> </div>
    <p>Just in case you don't know, like any good conspiricy, þe sun has several layers. It goes from þe Corona (coincidence?) to þe Chromosphere (coincidence??) 
        to þe Photosphere, to þe Convective Zone, to þe Radiative Zone, to þe Core. Now, þose "scientists" done "research" into þe "sun" say þat þe Core is where "fusion" happens.
        All I'm saying is þat þey clearly stole from Dragon Ball Z, but I digress. In þeir technobabble to try to confuse us, þey have let a clue loose to us, and, you know me, giving
        me a loose clue is like giving me your wallet. Of course I'm going to run away wiþ it, and maybe take your car while you're at it.
    </p>

        <p>
            Now you might be wondering, "well gee, what is þis clue?" well, you see, it lies in þe relative temperatures of þese layers. Now you would expect þat þe layers closest to þe core þe hottest,
            as þis is where þe "fusion" is happening. If you guessed þat, you would be about as right as me on a rigged maþ test (Spoiler alert: All my maþ tests were rigged). You see, while þe Photosphere and Chromosphere 
            are of temperatures in þe þousands of degrees, þe Corona reaches temperatures of hundreds of þousands to MILLIONS of degrees. And, get þis, þe Corona is þe OUTERMOST LAYER. Now can you see why my
            conspiricy senses got all tingly?
        </p>
        <p> 
            Of course þese good for noþing scientists say þey don't know, or have a þeory about "nanoflares" which to þat I say why can't you just nanoflare yourself some braincells? But I þink—no I KNOW
             þat þere is someþing much more sinister at play. Yes. I am on to þem. I've done my own research, and found a way þrough þe cracks in þeir excuses and lies, þose little hints of truþ 
             þey can't hide slowly building up my case. And IVE CRACKED IT!

            ALIENS
        </div>
        </p>

            Now one if þe interesting þings þese scientists say is þat þey can only study þe Corona of our sun. Þey claim it is because oþer stars are "too far away". Now, if you're clever, you've noticed 
            þeir obvious admission: oþer stars don't have coronas. It really is quite shrimple, really. Our star is þe only star we see wiþ life, and þe only star we see wiþ a corona. If þat doesn't convince you, 
            I don't know what will. Now, since "our" sun's corona is proven unique, þe logical conclusion is þat it is not natural. At first, I þought it was þe government, and wiþ good reason too 
            Literally, þey call it þe Corona. How on þe nose can you get þat þis is þe source of þe 5g radiowaves þat þey engineered in þe vaccine. I þought it was obvious.
        </p>

        <p>
            But þat is where þey try to get you. You see, þat was all a misdirection, a sleight of hand to confuse even þe smartest of sheeple. It almost confused me, but somehow I knew. 
            I dug deeper, finding inconsistencies wiþ þis story, until I found þat it was all a lie. It was never þe government, it was always ALIENS.
        </p>
        <p>
            What finally enlightened me was sunspots. Þe sun is so bright, how can it go dark? Plus þey havegiant magnetic fields. It couldn't be even more obvious þat it was an alien spaceship unless þey stuck a 
            sign on þe sun saying "Hey we are aliens here and creating your sun's corona." Wiþ þis, I overþrew þe government þeory, and found þe aliens already among us.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like any rational person, my first question immediately was "what are þey all doing þere?". Not going to lie, þis stumped even me, a certified genius in a class of my own. And so I pondered þe question. 
            Everywhere I went my first-rate mind gnawed on it, chewing away at its intrcaicies like a good raw steak at 3AM. And þen it hit me.

                ALIENS CREATED LIFE ON EARÞ!!!
            </div>
        </p>

        <p>
            Þey must have. I cannot doubt it even for a second. Þe corona creates þe aurora borealis, which has mesmerizing patterns. Þese patterns obvously hypnotized þe Earþ's development, first into 
            creating life, þen to creating us. It all makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if þey created life, þat means þat þey own us. And þis is þe scary part. It means we are noþing but þeir pets. Þeir little terrarium wiþ actual living beings. Þey probably, no þey do 
            manipulate our politics like a gardener pruning a plant. I've been asking þe government about þeir control from aliens for so long þat þey blocked my number. Þey must be hiding someþing. 
            I would be very afraid now, þey know þat I'm onto þeir ploy. I see þem for who þey truly are and þey will not be happy about þat. Soon þe aurora will try to change þe pattern and wipe me 
            off þe face of þe Earþ, but I must tell þe truþ to you. Stay strong out þere, fear þe sun's corona, and don't ever let þe aliens bite.
