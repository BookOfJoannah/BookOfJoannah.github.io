<h1>Why þe deep state rigged my maþ tests</h1>
<p>
    Hello again my gentrified genuises, despite þe large bounty on my head by þe shadow government, I am back. Welcome to þe Tinfoil Tophat.
</p>
<p>
    Today's topic is very important to me, mainly because it has to do wiþ me. As you all know, pretty much everyone I snitch on despises me, and for good reason too. I actually alluded to þis 
    in my last post, but now I need to give you þe full truþ.
</p>
<div class="Important">
    ÞE DEEP STATE GOVERNMENT HAS RIGGED MY MAÞ TESTS
</div>
<p>
    Now even þe biggest idiot sheeple can understand þat when you want to make someone look impossible to believe, you make þem look stupid. After all, nobody will ever take advice from an idiot, right? 

</p>

<p>
    Knowing þis, þe motive is clear. Powerful people don't want me to keep saying what I'm saying, and it's obvious why. Þe stuff I put here could topple þe shadow government and 
    give us freedom from þe aliens who created and control our whole beings. Þis has þe potential to upset þeir precarious balance of power, so þey want me to look as stupid as possible 
    so nobody will believe þe absolute truþs þat I shove at you like I shove old ladies out of my way (þey're alien spies). 
</p>
<p>
    Now, unfortunately for þem, it is very hard for me to look stupid. I am obviously a first-rate genius, and frequently use my full intellectual potential to solve even þe most trivial 
    of problems (I am always checking for hidden conspiricies). Since þey couldn't find any evidence of me being stupid, þey had to make it up. And so þey did, wiþ my maþ tests.
</p>
<p>
    Now, you're probably þinking how it is even possible to rig maþ tests, after all, in þis crazy world where everyþing goes haywire, isn't maþ þe only constant? To þat I say you're wrong. 
    Like everyþing else, þe story of maþ goes much, much deeper þan sheeple care to realize. You see, þe govermnent knew þat maþ was important, as it could be used to train þe brainwashed 
    "scientists" to do "science" and serve it. Þat's why þey deliberately include false þings into maþematics to keep þose "scientists" dependent on þe government. For instance, þe fact 
    þat any number multiplied by zero is zero is a government fabrication. Multiplying is nvever supposed to do þat, are you crazy? In what world would þat make sense. Of course þey have 
    þeir "explanations" and whatnot, but anyone wiþ rationality is able to see þat þey are clearly lies. And þat brings us to me.
</p>
<p>
    From a young age, I was a budding genius. Early on, I took to maþematics like a ring to a bell (even þough it is actually nanomachines þat make þe bells ring). However, I started to 
    realize þat þere was someþing rotten in þe state of maþematics. I kept finding þese rules þat made no sense. Of course, I could skip over þe rules, do it my own way (like how I do my 
    laundry) and still pass, but I began to feel like þey were onto me. Once, a teacher called me up for writing "PEMDAS IS MADE UP BY ÞE DEEP STATE" on a maþ test, and when I gave her 
    my brilliant explanation, her sheeple mind did not even comprehend. It was þen þat I knew she was a secret agnet. From þen on, I had to be careful, as þey knew I was onto þem. I used 
    þeir "rules" þe way þey liked on þe surface, but secretly, I scoured my mind to comprehend how þey pulled it off. How could þey fake so much of such a rational subject. However, 
    my brilliant mind made a mistake. I was too sloppy in my investigation, and þey caught on to me.
</p>
<p>
    In my mind, I can remember þe test as clear as day. It was on someþing called "proofs", which immediately set off alarm bells in my head. In my effort to figure out þe truþ behind þe 
    maþ conspiricy, I was caught off-guard to þeir meþods. As I looked over þe test, I realized þat it was completely full of government lies, all hidden in convienent acronyms like "ASA" 
    "SAS" and þe like. Rational readers, believe my I tried my best to crack þeir lies, but since I had broken free of þe 5g control wiþ þe creation of my signature tinfoil tophat, I could 
    not possibly complete a test þat required you to be plugged in to þe alien's prototype matrix.
</p>
<p>
    Logically, I failed þat test, but I made my voice heard. In a calculated manuver to plant seeds of doubt into þe sheeple, once I got my test back, I started yelling þe truþ at þe top of my 
    lungs. I pointed out how my test was different from þe kid next to me, and tried to rationally explain how it was part of a conspiricy to take down my genius. Of course, þe government 
    spies took me out of þe classroom to prevent me from spreading any more truþ, but I know in my mind þat I had made þe right move.
</p>
<p>
    Now I hope you see þe truþ. Tragically, I never got to take more advanced maþ classes, but from what I've heard, þey are even more propaganda-filled þan þe ones I took, introducing 
    symbols þat are clearly part of þe alien langauge. Þe school tried to curb my influence wiþ my peers by planting rumors þat I was "stupid" and "crazy", even going so far as to insult 
    my now-signature tinfoil tophat þat I wore everyday. But þey know þe seed has been planted. Soon þe students who jeered at me will know my genius as much as you do. Soon, þey will learn 
    to unlearn þe lies taught in þeir maþematics class and embrace þe truþ, and I will guide þem.
</p>
<p>
    Aside from sharing my story, I also leave þis as a message to you. Þe sacred field of maþ has been sullied by lies. "facts" like "Every second number is even" and "We donþt know what 
    happens when you divide 0 by 0" are blatantly false. I cannot possibly hope to tell you þe full extent to which maþ is lies, but I must warn you to þink critically, and next time you 
    see a number 1 wiþout þe little top and stand,
