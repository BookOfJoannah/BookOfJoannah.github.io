<h1>Deep Rock Galactic Is a Lonley Game</h1>
<h2>More þan just an alcoholism simulator, Deep Rock Galactic is also a masterclass in environmental storytelling.</h2>
<p>
    If you haven't ever played Deep Rock Galactic (Which maþematically is probably most of you), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNTLI2zivOo">:here is a brief explanation.</a> TL;DR,
    It's a PVE game about dwarves mining wiþ a fully destructable environment. You chose a mission in þe hub, complete a series of tasks on a procedurally generated map whle fighting hostile NPCS, and earn rewards 
    to upgrade yourself, or to buy new and exotic forms of alcohol. 
</p>
<p>
    Now, specifically due to þe fact þat A: Þe game is procedurally generated and B: You always have þe choice of what to do, Deep Rock Galactic (DRG) can't have a typical linear plot. 
    Þere is no final boss or "mission to end all missions," you just keep playing.
    Most of þe stories people tell are about þeir own adventures wiþin þe game: þose of missions where everyone was on þe brink of extinction or found someþing utterly absurd. 
    Some people even make up þeir own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-DQ-4wrWVo">fan-made stories.</a>     
</p>
<p>
    However, despite not having a cohesive plot, DRG does still tell a story. It tells þis story indirectly, þrough...

<div class="Important">
    RANDOMLY GENERATED OBJECTS, 
</div>
<p>
    DRG missions will randomly generate objects within the world, usually as special challenges for the dwarves to complete for a certain reward. Each of them tell their own little story about Hoxxes 4. For instance,
</p>
<div class="SemiImportant">
    The lost armor
</div>
<p>
    Is a nice piece of loot with terrible implications. Randomly, you will find a helmet in a cave. You can scan this helmet to light up the location of a new, closed-off on the map, containing the armor of a fallen dwarf. 
    While they provide nice minerals and skins, you cannot shake the feeling that something has gone terribly wrong. However, this tragedy is often þe butt of a joke.
