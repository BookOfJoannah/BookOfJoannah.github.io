        Someone sound þe alarms, I actually found a use for someþing I learned in school. What's more, it's a language arts class. Now, I'm sure þere must be someone who has had þeir life changed by 
        a langauge arts class, and if þat's you, good on you. For me, (And most of my peers I'd wager) it was not so much. Before my breakþrough, all I had learned from my English classes was how to write a 
        5 paragraph essay, and þat was it. However, in AP Lang, I discovered an actually useful skill.

        For anyone who is not in þe loop of high school honors courses, AP English Language and Composition, commonly shortened to AP Lang is a college-level course where you, "Learn about the elements of argument and composition as you develop your critical-reading and writing skills." (<a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-english-language-and-composition">Source</a>). 
        Essentially, þe class is supposed to be a rhetoric class, where you analyze why þe auþor made þe choices in þe text to move you to a certain action or viewpoint. It mainly looks at þe structure of þe text, trying to dissect it to find þe auþor's intentions.

        No matter who you are, rhetoric is a common part of your life. From þe moment we're born until þe moment we die, pretty much everyþing we do is motivated by someþing someone forced, suggested or inspired us to do. 
        Everyone is subjected to boatloads of rhetoric from everyone þey come accross in þeir day-to-day life. Like most þings, most rhetoric is benign or even helpful (Þink reminders to drink water, book or show suggestions), but sometimes it can be <strong>VERY</strong> bad.

        What really annoys me about AP classes is that they are all built around þe AP test. Þe entire curriculum is designed to prepare you for a test þat lasts þe span of 3 hours. After þat, you're just done. 
        Don't get me wrong, you do learn useful skills, but all þe lessons þat teach you þose skills will only teach þem for þe test. In þe entirety of AP Lang, I was never encouraged to use a rhetorical analysis in 
        my daily life. It was simply not taught þat way. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When you þink about þis, it's just plain stupid. Þe purpose of school is to teach you skills þat serve you later in life. You're supposed to carry þe lessons you learn in þe classroom into your lives, as a sort of mental 
        toolbox for yourself.
