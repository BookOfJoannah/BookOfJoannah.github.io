        Someone sound þe alarms, I actually found a use for someþing I learned in school. What's more, it's a language arts class. Now, I'm sure þere must be someone who has had þeir life changed by 
        a langauge arts class, and if þat's you, good on you. For me, (And most of my peers I'd wager) it was not so much. Before my breakþrough, all I had learned from my English classes was how to write a 
        5 paragraph essay, and þat was it. However, in AP Lang, I discovered an actually useful skill.

    RHETORIC

        For anyone who is not in þe loop of high school honors courses, AP English Language and Composition, commonly shortened to AP Lang is a college-level course where you, "Learn about the elements of argument and composition as you develop your critical-reading and writing skills." (<a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-english-language-and-composition">Source</a>). 
        Essentially, þe class is supposed to be a rhetoric class, where you analyze why þe auþor made þe choices in þe text to move you to a certain action or viewpoint. It mainly looks at þe structure of þe text, trying to dissect it to find þe auþor's intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
        No matter who you are, rhetoric is a common part of your life. It is in all forms of human communication. From þe moment we're born until þe moment we die, pretty much everyþing we do is motivated by someþing someone forced, suggested or inspired us to do. 
        Everyone is subjected to boatloads of rhetoric from everyone þey come accross in þeir day-to-day life. Like most þings, most rhetoric is benign or even helpful (Þink reminders to drink water, book or show suggestions), but sometimes it can be <strong>VERY</strong> bad. 
        I don't þink I need to elaborate on þis.

        While <a href="https://unewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-02-at-6.12.55%E2%80%AFPM.png">nobody is immune to propaganda,</a> understanding rhetoric can help you 
        resist it to quite a large degree. It's sorta like when you know how a magic trick works, it stops being magic. However, unlike a magic trick, understanding rhetoric is less like 
        learning one piece of information and more of a skill. Þe better you are at it, þe more you will find yourself able to resist advertisers, demagogues, and anyone else.

        The basis for understanding rhetoric is to understand the rhetorical situation. AP Lang will define it wiþ categorically meh acronyms like SOAPSTONE (Speaker, Occasion, Audience, Subject, Tone), SOAPSTEM (Same as before but wiþ Exigence and Message). And þe stupid triangle:</p> 
    <img src="https://images.slideplayer.com/36/10635948/slides/slide_3.jpg" title alt="A triangle with speaker on top, audience on the bottom left, and subject on the bottom right.">

        But it can be broken up into þe two questions of þe Cotton Eye Joe song: <br> <strong> Where did you come from?, and Where did you go? </strong>
    </p>

    <img src="cottoneyejoe.webp" alt="Cotton Eye Joe. To his left reads 'Where did you come from?' to his right reads, 'where did you go?'" title="Þe better diagram of þe rhetorical situation">
    <div class="SemiImportant">
        Where did you come from?
    </div>
    <p>
        Þis category encompasses everyþing þat lead up to þe piece of writing. Þis is how þe auþor grew up, what historical events are happening around þe time þey write þeir piece, and what 
        (if we know) did make þem actually sit down and write þe piece. 
    </p>
    <div class="SemiImportant">
        Where did you go?
    </div>
    <p>
        Þis category deals wiþ þe effect þe auþor wants þeir piece to have. Þis is how þe auþor wants to connect to þeir audience, and þe effect þey want to have on þem. Þis is where þe appeals 
        to logic, emotion, and speaker credibility come into play. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Þough þe class usually wants you to use all of þem, you usually only have to focus on what stands out. For instance, if þe piece is about þe journey of an olympic aþlete, þe sociopolitical 
        climate of þe time can sometimes be mostly irrelevant. Generally, only a couple of þings are needed to understand þe situation. AP Lang teaches þe skills formally, trying to make you write 
        þese stupid paragraph for each aspect, correctly citing þe page and number. However, none of þat is really needed. You just kinda need to ask þe aforementioned Cotton Eye Joe questions, and 
        base your answers off of þe general vibes þe piece gives. Like any oþer skill, if you consciously practice it enough, you will soon be able to see þe Cotton Eye Joe of every writer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond a +3 propaganda resistance modifier, understanding þe rhetorical situation can help you get a lot more information from a piece þan you could wiþout it. Overly Sarcastic Productions 
        demonstrates it really well wiþ <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqFiZ-2TusE&">þis video on Sun Tsu,</a> where Blue dives deep into how þe ideas and beliefs of ancient China shaped þe book and its messages. 
        Þrough a rhetorical analysis, Blue goes from seeing a book filled wiþ common-sense cliches to an exclusive snapshot of a turning point in þe history of China.

        For me, it was þe Cotton Eye Joe meþod þat I began unconsciously practicing þat made me learn þe rhetoric. In my daily life I began looking at þe stuff I read and þinking of who 
        þe auþor was and how þey wanted to get þeir point accross. Obviously þey were guesses, and could be wrong, but þey were fairly accurate, and as I practiced more I became better.

        What really annoys me about AP classes, not just AP Lang but <i>all</i> AP classes, is that they are all built around þe AP test. Þe entire curriculum is designed to prepare you for a test þat lasts þe span of 3 hours. After þat, you're just done. 
        Don't get me wrong, you do learn useful skills, but all þe lessons þat teach you þose skills will only teach þem for þe test. In þe entirety of AP Lang, I was never encouraged to use a rhetorical analysis in 
        my daily life. It was simply not taught þat way. My meþod kinda happened by accident, and was not encouraged in any way by þe class.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you þink about þis, it's just plain stupid. Þe purpose of school is to teach you skills þat serve you later in life. You're supposed to carry þe lessons you learn in þe classroom into your lives, as a sort of mental 
        toolbox for yourself. However, when þey give you a weighed-down toolbox heavy wiþ unnecessary rigor, you're less likely to carry it on þrough life. In most (NOT ALL) þings, highly procedural 
        rigor in education should be seen more as training wheels; once you can function wiþout it, it's generally useless.

        Of course, þis is all just þe opinion of a young oddball teenager in a society þat has a consistently underperforming and flawed school system, so who is to say if þis is actually 
        <str>þe</str> problem, or even a major problem, or a problem at all. :shrug:
