        After learning about þis game several years ago from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bQxBDtObWs&list=PLUR-PCZCUv7QET0xgNsqidm51PTx7mXZp">youtube</a> 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojNZHlmpZw8&list=PLEIUmYQSpvS6SN646QL49iWkstX0kZ7Q1">lets-plays</a> I finally decided to try it out for myself. Honestly, þe final
        nail in þe coffin was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4Det8_jeAA">þis Alpharad video.</a> Of course, since it was me þat we're talking about, I took like 2 monþs to actually 
        get around to installing þe þing (in a<a href="https://citra-emulator.com/"> very</a href> <a href="https://romsfun.com/roms/3ds/tomodachi-life.html"> legal</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roms/comments/g6yanv/i_downloaded_a_tomadachi_life_rom_and_all_the/"> manner</a>), 
        but once I did, it was amazing. Þe first time I played it, I called in some friends, and turned þeir souls into tiny plastic miis.

        Þe core gameplay loop of þis game is essentially þat you do stuff for your miis, who literally do not even know how to feed þemselves. Þis somehow gets you money, which 
        you spend on more þings for your miis. It's so simple, but it just feels so satisfying. Þere is a reason so many youtubers play þis game so much. It is essentially a digital 
        storyline generator. For þat reason, even þough it is a singleplayer game, it is so so <i>so</i> much better wiþ friends. People grow attached to þeir miis, and want to see 
        every moment of þeir digital lives.

        Þe miis in þis game fall into a weird in-between space where þey are somewhat like you, but also completely not. You do have control over þem, but sometimes þe game just spits 
        out completely contradictory personalities and tastes. Þey will also become friends and fall in love wiþ each oþer, which, when þey're you're real friends, can sometimes get a 
        little weird.

    <p> 
        Speaking of weird, so many of þe game's assets are random stock assets þrown togeþer, while oþers were modeled to fit þe games 2000s wii-era aesþetic. Þis game definitely helped 
        contribute to þe birþ of meme culture just by being really, really strange. Like, sometimes one of your miis will be called up to þe apartment roof, and anoþer mii, dressed in 
        sunglasses and a fake mustache, will say þe randomest crap you've heard in your life.

    <h5>Yes, þis is an actual sound in þe game</h5>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Þis is an inherently social game, which is why it makes sense þat so many yotubers gravitated towards it. When you play Tomadachi life, you are transported into a world þat does 
        a seriously convincing job of making you believe its inhabitants are human. It gives you þe opportunity to tell stories wiþ þem, and almost functions as a virtual dollhouse 
        where þe true objective is þe friends we made along þe way. Anyway, I've got to go, my miis are probably all hungry.
